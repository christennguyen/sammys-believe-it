        Sam and Christen meet on a dating app and finally meet in September of
        2021. The two protaganists go on date after date to discover that they
        share a love for similar things in life. Soon enough, they find
        themselves embarking on adventures of music, food, and travel. More than
        that, they begin to learn and enjoy the depths of each partner's
        character, motives, and their joys and fears in life and fall in love.
