      Sam and Christen meet on a dating app and go on date after date to
      discover that they share a love for similar things in life. Soon enough,
      they find themselves embarking on adventures of music, food, and travel.
      More than that, they begin to learn and enjoy the depths of each other's
      character, motives, and their joys and fears in life and fall in love.
      <br />
      <br />
      In their year of dating, the two travel all over the US. They hit major
      cities such as New York, San Diego, Nashville, and Portland. There they
      experience a variety of terrain from snow to storm, to thick, humid heat.
      <br />
      <br />
      Where will Sam and Christen's adventures take them in year two?
